## **ðŸš€ Feature Request: New Utility Proposal for `@naverpay/hidash`**

### **1. Requested Utility**  
- Describe the utility function you would like to see in `@naverpay/hidash`.  
- Explain its purpose and typical use cases.  

### **2. Unpkg URL**  
- Provide the corresponding Unpkg CDN link (if available):  
  ```
  https://unpkg.com/lodash.<utility-function>
  ```

### **3. Lodash Documentation**  
- Add the official Lodash documentation link for reference:  
  ```
  https://lodash.com/docs/#<utility-function>
  ```

### **4. TypeScript Types (`@types/lodash`)**  
- Include the corresponding TypeScript type definition link (if available):  
  ```
  https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/lodash#<utility-function>
  ```

### 5. Additional Considerations

- Should support nested path selection like `'a.b.c'`.
- Should work with symbol-based keys.
- Must handle nullish objects gracefully.
